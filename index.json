2017）,我仍然希望能够着眼于波动去讨论台风活动的问题（冯涛等，2016；Feng et al. 2020c）。研究台风的多尺度变率，对于季节至长期台风预测都有比较重要的作用。但是近年来，我在该方向的研究投入精力较少，往往是以合作的文章为主，主要原因之一是因为我在该方向上缺乏试验论证手段。单个台风的数值模拟试验需要消耗大量的计算资源，而台风的年际-年代际变化需要的资源十分夸张。如果具有足够的计算能力进行试验论证，并且将台风的多尺度变率进行定量化讨论，我个人认为仍然是个十分有意思的方向。\n另一个相关的工作已经在近期完成。在西北太平洋台风多尺度变率研究的文章中，相当一部分机理都要通过西北太平洋季风槽的变化来解释。然而，目前对于季风槽的定义并不一致，甚至连AMS的气象术语表中对于季风槽的定义都存在很明显的问题。Molinari and Vollaro将这些定义总结在了他们的文章之中(Molinari and Vollaro 2012)，他们认为季风槽只有定义在气候平均的角度上时才是有意义的。然而，这明显与我们的惯常操作相违背，因为我们经常在逐日天气图上分析季风槽的变化。因此，基于前人的研究与AMS的气象术语表，我们提出了一种在逐日尺度上的季风槽定义: an elongated area in a weather map showing relatively low atmospheric pressure consisting of easterly trade winds and westerly monsoonal winds（Feng et al. 2020d）。该定义导出有几个关键：\n 从概念上区分季风槽、MJO、以及各种热带波动现象 从概念上和技术上区别季风槽环流与台风环流 提出了一个在全年可用的季风槽指数（西北太平洋季风槽只存在于北半球夏季，而之前的指数在冬季的时候都会误报存在季风槽）  我们希望这个季风槽指数能在台风多尺度变率，以及台风-环流相互作用的研究中发挥作用。\n 热带对流 有关热带对流的研究是我2018年去台湾访问之后才开始感兴趣的内容。原本我只是想用一些简单的工具诊断一下TD波之中对流耦合的机制，谁料却发现这是更加迷人的一座高山。热带大气中的深对流活动对大气环流有决定性的影响，相关研究基本可以分为两大主题：\n 对流导致的潜热加热如何在各个时间尺度上影响大气环流； 大气环流的变化如何影响深对流的活动。  前者而言，Gill Response几乎能够解释绝大部分的大气环流异常问题；而对后者而言，教科书的学习让我只记得了对流不稳定和CISK（第二类条件不稳定），然而实际上新的理论层出不穷，花样繁多，比如convective quasi-equilibrium就有多个版本，实在是令人眼花缭乱。热带对流研究所涵盖的范围非常广，包括了海气相互作用、云-辐射相互作用等。我目前仍然是个初学者，但是对这个课题抱有极大的兴趣，未来的多年时间我也许更多会花在这个方向上。现在我主要基于Gross moist stability的理论框架解释波动中的对流活动；我的研究生郑涛同学也在这个方向进行探索，尝试用一些简单的诊断工具解释降水的变率。但是另一方面，就我查阅的有限文献来看，国内学者对这个方向的研究不是太多，因此国内同行的交流与学习会比较困难。想要从事这个方向的研究，还需要加强与海外的合作，目前我主要与台湾中央大学的余嘉裕教授进行合作，他是gross moist stability最早的研究者之一。尽管这个课题已经超出了物理海洋学研究的范畴，尽管这个课题比较困难，但是越难的问题其实越有意思，欢迎有不畏艰险的老师和同学一起进行探索。\n","date":1588118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1588118400,"objectID":"764a8e1ea8ec9dc7cf39dd70f0b81435","permalink":"https://tfeng7.github.io/post/myinterest/","publishdate":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/myinterest/","section":"post","summary":"简述我的三个研究方向。","tags":[""],"title":"台风、对流与热带波动","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"对流耦合MRG波西传过程中的垂直结构变化及湿过程的作用机制\nFeng, T., X.-Q.

A monsoon trough can be identified as active when the daily index is greater than $2.0×10^{-4} s^{-1}$. Active monsoon troughs occur during half of the summertime, and these is no monsoon trough on one-third of days, with the remaining days categorized as inactive. The most active month is August, in which approximately twenty days exhibit an active monsoon trough. Using this index, an active monsoon trough period, which is related to vigorous TC activity, was determined by identifying the establishment and decay dates for each year from 1979 to 2016. During most years, the active monsoon trough is established in mid-July and decays in late October, persisting for three to five months during the boreal summer. Moreover, spectral and wavelet analyses demonstrated the presence of intraseasonal, interannual and interdecadal variabilities in the monsoon trough.

The essential difference between these two wave trains is found in their vertical structures. In 2004, the maximum perturbations occurred from the middle to lower troposphere with an equivalent barotropic structure; however, in 2006, they primarily occurred in the upper troposphere with a prominent tilt regarding height. Distinct configurations of the monsoon troughs, the tropical upper-tropospheric troughs (TUTT), and associated vertical wind shear caused such structural differences. In 2004, the TUTT shifted eastward, creating an easterly sheared environment to confine synoptic-scale waves in the lower troposphere. Then, the monsoon trough enhanced the wave activity through barotropic energy conversion in the lower troposphere. In contrast, while the TUTT shifted westward in 2006, synoptic-scale waves prevailed in the upper troposphere by the environmental westerly shear. Meanwhile, the disturbances developed in the upper troposphere through to the conversion of kinetic energy from the TUTT, exhibiting a top-heavy vertical structure.

During Kalmaegi and Fung-Wong, three distinct cold patches were observed at sea surface. The locations of these cold patches are highly correlated with relatively shallower depth of the 26 °C isotherm and mixed layer depth (MLD) and lower upper ocean heat content. The enhancement of surface chlorophyll a (chl-a) concentration was detected in these three regions as well, mainly due to the TC-induced mixing and upwelling as well as the terrestrial runoff. Moreover, the pre-existing ocean cyclonic eddy (CE) has been found to significantly modulate the magnitude of surface cooling and chl-a increase. With the deepening of the MLD on the right side of TCs, the temperature of the mixed layer decreased and the salinity increased. The sequential TCs had superimposed effects on the upper ocean response. The possible causes of sudden track change in sequential TCs scenario were also explored.

More TCs formed in the eastern region of the WNP and the northern region of the South China Sea (SCS). More TCs took the northeast quadrant in the WNP, recurving from northwestward to northward and causing heavy damages in mainland China (69.73 billion yuan) in 2018. Multiscale climate variability is conducive to an active season via an enhanced monsoon trough and a weakened subtropical high in the WNP. The large-scale backgrounds in 2018 showed a favorable environment for TCs established by a developing central Pacific (CP) El Niño and positive Pacific meridional mode (PMM) episode on interannual timescales. The tropical central Pacific (TCP) SST forcing exhibits primary control on TCs in the WNP and large-scale circulations, which are insensitive to the PMM. During CP El Niño years, anomalous convection associated with the TCP warming leads to significantly increased anomalous cyclonic circulation in the WNP because of a Gill-type Rossby wave response. As a result, the weakened subtropical high and enhanced monsoon trough shift eastward and northward, which favor TC genesis and development. Although such increased TC activity in 2018 might be slightly suppressed by interdecadal climate variability, it was mostly attributed to the favorable interannual background. In addition, high-frequency climate signals, such as intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) and synoptic-scale disturbances (SSDs), interacted with the enhanced monsoon trough and strongly modulated regional TC genesis and development in 2018.\nWu, L.*, H.

Following the strong El Niño event in the preceding winter, the typhoon season was inactive in 1998 while active in 2016. Compared with 1998, the monsoon trough (MT) in 2016 shifted more eastwards, leading to an increase of the mid‐level water vapour, lower‐tropospheric relative vorticity and upper‐tropospheric divergence, and a decrease of the vertical wind shear. Additionally, the eastwards extension of the MT in 2016 induced more active tropical depression (TD)‐type waves than those in 1998. The analysis of the energy budget suggested that the eastwards shift of the MT during the 2016 typhoon season provided increased eddy kinetic energy for typhoon genesis, due to the joint contributions of the meridional shear of the mean zonal winds and the zonal wind convergence over the WNP. Moreover, the WNP entered a La Niña‐like SST pattern after July 2016. The relatively slower developing process of this pattern sustained the warmer SST anomalies and the anomalous cyclonic circulation, which the eastwards extension of the MT can be attributed. Hence, compared to 1998, the active typhoon season in 2016 is attributed to the eastwards extension of the MT, more active TD‐type wave activities, and slow developing process of a La Niña‐like SST pattern in 2016 typhoon season.\nHuangfu, J.*, R.

Four distinctly different forms of tropical Pacific warming are identified to examine different impacts of locations and intensity of tropical Pacific warming on the WNP TCs. It is shown that WNP TC activity related to ENSO shows stronger sensitivity to the intensity of CP SST warming. The locations of TC genesis in an extreme EP El Niño featuring concurrent strong CP and EP warming (CEPW) display a notable southeastward shift that is generally similar to the CP El Niño featuring CP warming alone (CPW). These influences are clearly different from the effects of moderate EP El Niño associated with EP warming alone (EPW). The above influences of Pacific warming on TCs possibly occur via atmospheric circulation variability. Anomalous convection associated with CP SST warming drives anomalous low-level westerlies away from the equator as a result of a Gill-type Rossby wave response, leading to an enhanced broad-zone, eastward-extending monsoon trough (MT). An anomalous Walker circulation in response to EP SST warming drives an increase in anomalous equatorial westerlies over the WNP, leading to a narrow-zone, slightly equatorward shift of the eastward-extending MT. These changes in the MT coincide with a shift in large-scale environments and synoptic-scale perturbations, which favor TC genesis and development. In addition, during weaker EP SST warming (WEPW) with similar intensity to CPW, local SST forcing exhibits primary control on WNP TCs and atmospheric circulation.\nWu, L.*, H. Zhang, J.-M.

In this study, we focus on investigating this relationship, through theoretical consideration based on an analytical approach and diagnostic analysis of the historical forecasts produced by multiple dynamical models. The probabilistic forecast skill is gauged in terms of its two different attributes: resolution and reliability, while the deterministic forecast skill is measured in terms of anomaly correlation (AC). Through the theoretical consideration under certain simplified assumptions, a nonlinear, monotonic relationship is analytically derived between the resolution and the AC. Subsequent diagnostic analysis shows that the resolution and AC skills of both the multimodel ensemble and its member single models indeed appear to be approximately monotonically and nonlinearly related, specifically when they are calculated in a zonally aggregated manner by which the impact of finite sample size is reduced. This observed relationship has a specific form that is consistent with what the theory predicts. In short, the theoretical result is well verified by the dynamical model forecasts. Diagnostic analysis also shows that no good relationship exists between the reliability and the AC, signifying the difference of reliability and resolution in nature. A specific application of the proven resolution‐AC coherence is also demonstrated. The proved resolution‐AC relationship can facilitate comparisons among various assessments of seasonal climate prediction skill from the deterministic or probabilistic perspective alone.\nYang, D., X.-Q.

Meanwhile, the wintertime midlatitude Northern Hemispheric atmospheric circulation and East Asian climate have also undergone substantial interdecadal changes. The effect of the TPIO warming on these interdecadal changes are identified by a suite of AMIP-type atmospheric general circulation model experiments in which the model is integrated from September 1948 to December 1999 with prescribed historical, observed realistic sea surface temperature (SST) in a specific region and climatological SST elsewhere. Results show that the TPIO warming reproduces quite well the observed Northern Hemispheric wintertime interdecadal changes, suggesting that these interdecadal changes primarily originate from the TPIO warming. However, each sub-region of TPIO has its own distinct contribution. Comparatively, the tropical central-eastern Pacific (TCEP) and tropical western Pacific (TWP) warming makes dominant contributions to the observed positive-phase PNA-like interdecadal anomaly over the North Pacific sector, while the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) warming tends to cancel these contributions. Meanwhile, the TIO and TWP warming makes dominant contributions to the observed positive NAO-like interdecadal anomaly over the North Atlantic sector as well as the interdecadal anomalies over the Eurasian sector, although the TWP warming’s contribution is relatively small. These remote responses are directly attributed to the TPIO warming-induced tropical convection, rainfall and diabatic heating increases, in which the TIO warming has the most significant effect. Moreover, the TPIO warming excites a Gill-type pattern anomaly over the tropical western Pacific, with a low-level anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the Philippine Sea. Of three sub-regions, the TIO warming dominates such a pattern, although the TWP warming tends to cancel this effect. The anticyclonic circulation anomaly intensifies the southwesterly flow that transfers more moisture from the Bay of Bengal to East Asia and considerably increases the winter precipitation over the southern East Asia. This is strongly supported by the observational fact that there has been a significant interdecadal increase of winter precipitation over the southern China since the end of the 1970s.\nChu, C., X.-Q.

The results showed that the number of TCs forming to the east of 140°E over the southeastern part of the western North Pacific (WNP) is in highly positive correlation with the variation of the CEF near 125°E and 150°E, i.e., the number of tropical cyclogeneses increases when the cross-equatorial flows are strong. Composite analyses showed that during the years of strong CEF, the variations of OLR, vertical wind shear between 200-850 hPa, 850 hPa relative vorticity and 200 hPa divergence are favorable for tropical cyclogenesis to the east of 140°E over the tropical WNP, and vice versa. Moreover, it is also discussed from the view of barotropic energy conversion that during the years of strong CEF, an eastward-extended monsoon trough leads to the rapid growth of eddy kinetic energy over the eastern part of WNP, which is favorable for tropical cyclogenesis; but during the years of weak CEF, the monsoon trough is located westward in the western part of the WNP, consistent with the growth area of eddy kinetic energy. As a result, there are fewer TC geneses over the eastern part of WNP.

An interdecadal decrease in the frequency of the WNP TC genesis was observed during 1998–2013 compared to the period of 1979–1997. The spatial distribution of the interdecadal decrease of the WNP TC genesis running northwest‐southeast, consistent with the monsoon trough (MT) zone. The results imply that the WNP genesis may be closely related to the MT on the interdecadal timescale. After the late 1990s, the intensity of the WNP MT becomes weaker and it extends more westward, thereby providing an unfavourable condition for the TC genesis. Through a diagnosis of the energetics, we suggested that the barotropic energy conversion in the eastern part of the WNP MT tends to be weakened in the late 1990s, hence less energy to support the WNP TC genesis. Both the meridional shear and the convergence of the mean zonal winds over the eastern WNP MT have an important impact on the conversion from mean kinetic energy to eddy kinetic energy, which can be considered as the atmospheric cause of the interdecadal decrease of TC genesis.\nHuangfu, J.*, R.

By applying spatiotemporal ﬁlters to the observed OLR data and the NCEP–DOE AMIP-II reanalysis data for 1979–2013, this study reveals the characteristics and energetics of convectively coupled TD-type waves under the effects of different circulation patterns in association with vertical wind shear. Results exhibit that different ambient sheared ﬂows signiﬁcantly affect the vertical structure of westward-propagating TD-type waves, with a lower-tropospheric mode in an easterly sheared background and an upper-tropospheric mode in a westerly sheared background. Energetic diagnoses demonstrate that when the disturbance is trapped in the lower (upper) level by easterly (westerly) shear, the horizontal mean ﬂow in the lower (upper) level favors wave growth by converting energy from the shear of the zonal mean ﬂow (from the convergence of the meridional mean ﬂow). During the penetration of a westward-propagating synoptic-scale disturbance from a westerly sheared ﬂow into an easterly sheared ﬂow, the upper-level disturbance decays, and the lower-level disturbance intensiﬁes. Meanwhile, the upper-level kinetic energy is transferred downward, but the effect induces the wave growth only conﬁned to the midlevels. Consequently, the low-level growth of the westward-propagating upper-level synoptic-scale disturbance is mainly attributed to the barotropic conversion of horizontal mean ﬂow in the lower troposphere.\nFeng, T., X.-Q.
